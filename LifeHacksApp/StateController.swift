        title: "How to find a hole in a bicycle tire tube quickly",
        body: "The tube inside by bicycle tire (inner-tube) got a hole and now I can't ride the bike. It isn't a big hole, so I am going to repair it myself. The only problem is that it takes an extremely long time to find the hole. I usually run my finger around the entire tube looking for it, until I eventually find it. This usually takes 20-30 minutes. There must be an better alternative. What is an easy way to quickly find a hole in a tire tube?",
