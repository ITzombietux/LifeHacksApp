The only problem is that it takes an extremely long time to find the hole. I usually run my finger around the entire tube looking for it, until I eventually find it. This usually takesN 20-30 minutes. There must be an better alternative. What is an easy way to quickly find a hole in a tire tube?"

I thought about using ziploc bags but it's hard to pour from the bag into the water cup without spilling powder everywhere."
